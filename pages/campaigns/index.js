const markdownText = `As of today, India is undergoing a severe second wave of COVID-19 with the worldâ€™s highest daily new cases. Hospitals and healthcare providers are running out of resources in the fight against COVID-19 and the situation on the ground is dire. Oxygen is critically required to treat patients affected with COVID-19, many of whom require hospitalization. However, there is a severe shortage of oxygen across hospitals in India.

We are raising funds to help procure and distribute oxygen concentrators across hospitals in need. These oxygen concentrators can save many thousands of lives and bolster much-needed resources for hospitals. They can also be used to treat outpatients, reducing the load on hospital beds and easing the stress faced by patients.
